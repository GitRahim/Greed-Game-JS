# Greed-Game-JS
This game is implemented with HTML, CSS and JS. I created this during learning JS with Jonas's JS udemy course. 
It's a two player on the same device game. When it's your turn you can roll the dice as many as you want so far that the dice number isn't 1; if it's 1, it'll be your opponent's turn. each time you roll the dice, it's number will be added to your score(unless dice is 1, which means all the scores of current turn are gone). So in order to not lose your current turn score and keep it to be added to your total score, you can "hold" your current turn score and give the turn to your opponent. Anyone whose score reaches 50 will be the winner.
